movestring:

. wait one move
, wait one tick

Directions must be uppercase.
A direction followed by a lowercase direction is a diagonal move.
For example, Ul is an UP move with a diagonal direction of LEFT.

Any of the above can be preceded by a number, which means that the move is repeated that many times.
For example, 5L is the same as LLLLL.

Spaces are ignored. Any other character is an error.

LRUD and . are implicitly separated from each other by 4 ticks. The comma is separated from any others by 1 tick. In other words, the solution LLLD is the same as L3,L3,L3,D
