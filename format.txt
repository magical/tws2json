X+X    Diagonal move

*X     Mouse click (one direction)
*X;X   Mouse click (two directions)
*.     Mouse click (on Chip)

Any direction can be preceded by a number, which means that the move is repeated that many times. For example, 5L is the same as LLLLL.

The uppercase directions are equivalent to a lowercase direction followed by "3,". For example, L is the same as "L3,".


Spaces are ignored. Any other character is an error.

A Discussion
------------

We have, really, two separate problems here: MS mode and Lynx mode. In Lynx mode, one tends to hold down the keys, so we have, say, a stream of L for 12 frames followed by a U for 15 frames, followed by nothing for 3 frames, and so on. In MS mode, one usually hits the keys repeatedly. So you (ideally) have keypresses separated by 4 frames.

Tile World complicates this by discarding keystrokes which happen when Chip is not allowed to move (such as when another move was executed less than 4 frames ago, or when being forced by ice or force floor tiles).

The notation used by chipsters isn't much concerned with timing information; more with encoding the optimal path through a level. It is assumed that moves will be executed as quickly as possible. If pauses are necessary they are given explicitly.
 
Personally i think Tile World is wrong. I feel that the solution should encode the entire, unabridged input stream.
